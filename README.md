Purpose: This program demonstrates a functional simple calculator using GUI. I utilized Java Swing classes and methods to accomplish this task. For instance, I used JTextFields, JButton, JLabel, and more.
         Also, I inserted Expection Handling to evaluate the user's input. 

Test Cases:
  (Multiply Case)
  First Number: 3
  Second Number: 2
  Selection: Multiply
  Result: 6

  (Division)
  First Number: 1
  Second Number: 0
  Selection: Divide
  Result: Error: Cannot divide by zero
